# Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge

## Purpose:

#### Use the bacterial data for each volunteer to create visual graphs. The goal is to allow users to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer's belly button. If Improbable Beef identifies a specific bacteria as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, they can quickly locate the volunteers. This webpage and graphs will make the data easy to access and understand. 

## Results:

#### Researchers can select a volunteer's ID on the left-hand side of the screen. When the webpage is first accessed, the page loads the data for the first volunteer on the list. Every time a new volunteer is selected, the demographics panel and graphs refresh to display the data for that specific volunteer. The bar graph illustrates the top 10 bacteria found in the selected volunteer's belly button. The gauge graph shows how frequently the volunteers washed their belly buttons per week. At the bottom of the page is the bubble graph. This graph plots every bacteria found on the selected volunteers belly buttom. This graph lets the user easily locate the bacteria with a larger precence.

## Summary:

#### Data sets are often very large and housed under names that are usually abbreviated. This makes data harder for those not familiar with the collection and documentation process to digest the results. By restructuring the data using JavaScript, the data can be renamed to something familiar to anyone. Furthermore, JavaScript allows us to create visuals such as panels and graphs. These visuals make our data even easier to digest. Overall, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are beneficial tools that help translate complex data into more understandable formats.
